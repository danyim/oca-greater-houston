<h1>About OCA</h1>

<p>OCA - Greater Houston is a 501(c)3 non-profit, non-partisan, social justice advocacy organization dedicated to securing the rights of Asian Pacific Americans in the United States.</p>

<p>In 1973, OCA catalyzed into being with the vision of uniting Chinese Americans across the United States into one representative voice. Interest and concern had been stirring in different pockets of the country since the late 1980s. The movement started to grow as numbers of the Chinese American communities began to rally together. </p>
<p>OCA recognized a need for a group to be a voice for Chinese Americans as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) were for their respective ethnic groups. While this vision of a united representative voice was shared with all founding members, more importantly, they decided to focus on Chinese American issues and concerns in the U.S., instead of the divisive issues concerning their "homeland." </p>
<p>Today, there are over 80 OCA chapters and affiliates across the country working on behalf of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent as an organization dedicated to advancing the social, political and economic well-being of Asian Pacific Americans. The many achievements of OCA over the past 37 years have been possible only through the commitment of many dedicated friends, members, officers, family, corporate partners, colleagues and leaders in the Chinese and Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Yet, there is much left to do to accomplish our mission. We must continue the vision of "Embracing the Hopes and Aspirations of Asian Pacific Americans."</p>

<p>Consistent with the changing demographics and a National Resolution passed in January 2013, OCA embarked on a formal brand & legal name change from "Organization of Chinese Americans" to "OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates".</p>

<h2 id="what-is-oca-">What is OCA?</h2>
<p>Founded in 1973, OCA is a national organization dedicated to advancing the social, political, and economic well-being of Asian Pacific Americans in the United States. OCA&#39;s goals are:
to advocate for social justice, equal opportunity and fair treatment;
to promote civic participation, education, and leadership;
to advance coalitions and community building; and
to foster cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, OCA is engaged in organizing its 80+ chapters and affiliates across the nation and its Hong Kong chapter to develop both leadership and community involvement. Our chapters and college affiliates work to establish strong local programs that empower the APIA community through cultural awareness programs, leadership training, education workshops, legislative monitoring, public policy initiatives, APIA conferences, internships, scholarships, publications, and community activism across the country. </p>
<p>OCA&#39;s base in Washington, D.C. gives the national office an effective vantage point for monitoring legislation and policy issues affecting Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American communities. In the D.C. metro area, OCA is able to build national support and to work in coalition with other national groups around issues affecting APIAs. In addition, OCA publishes IMAGE magazine, which serves as a communications link for chapter members as well as an informative source on federal and legislative initiatives and policies relevant to the APIA community. </p>
<p>For more information about OCA, email us at OCA@OCANATL.ORG, call us at (202) 223-5500, or write to us at 1001 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 601, Washington D.C. 20036. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-oca-houston-">What is OCA Houston?</h2>
<p>The Greater Houston Chapter was established in 1979, after OCA National founder and president, K.L. Wang encouraged local community leaders at that time to become part of this new national effort and advocate for protecting and advancing the rights of Chinese Americans and Asian Pacific Americans. </p>
<p>OCA-Greater Houston can boast about its successful record in participating both at the national and local levels in accomplishing its mission. OCA-GH has earned the National Chapter Excellence Awards Chapter of the Year for 3rd place in 2004 &amp; 2005.
