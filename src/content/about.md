#EMBRACING THE HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS 

## What is OCA?
Founded in 1973, OCA is a national organization dedicated to advancing the social, political, and economic well-being of Asian Pacific Americans in the United States. OCA's goals are:
to advocate for social justice, equal opportunity and fair treatment;
to promote civic participation, education, and leadership;
to advance coalitions and community building; and
to foster cultural heritage.

To achieve these objectives, OCA is engaged in organizing its 80+ chapters and affiliates across the nation and its Hong Kong chapter to develop both leadership and community involvement. Our chapters and college affiliates work to establish strong local programs that empower the APIA community through cultural awareness programs, leadership training, education workshops, legislative monitoring, public policy initiatives, APIA conferences, internships, scholarships, publications, and community activism across the country. 

OCA's base in Washington, D.C. gives the national office an effective vantage point for monitoring legislation and policy issues affecting Asian & Pacific Islander American communities. In the D.C. metro area, OCA is able to build national support and to work in coalition with other national groups around issues affecting APIAs. In addition, OCA publishes IMAGE magazine, which serves as a communications link for chapter members as well as an informative source on federal and legislative initiatives and policies relevant to the APIA community.
